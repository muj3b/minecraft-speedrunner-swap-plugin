# SpeedrunnerSwap

Dream-style "Speedrunner Swap" challenge: action-bar timer, blackout UI, chat isolation, multi-runner, jittered swaps, safe-swaps, GUIs, hunter tracker.

## Overview

## Key Features

- **Blackout UI**: Inactive runners get blindness and can't move or interact
- **Action Bar Timer**: Shows countdown to next swap and runner status
- **Multi-Runner Support**: More than two runners can rotate turns
- **Hunter Tracking**: Compass always points to active runner
- **Safe Swaps**: Protection from dangerous blocks like void/lava
- **Intuitive GUIs**: Team selector, settings menu, main menu
- **Complete State Syncing**: Inventory, armor, health, effects, location, and more
- **Voice Chat Integration**: Works with Simple Voice Chat plugin
