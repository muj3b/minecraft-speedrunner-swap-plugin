# SpeedrunnerSwap

SpeedrunnerSwap is a feature-rich, production-ready Minecraft plugin for Paper/Spigot 1.20.6, designed to be the definitive, open-source version of the "Speedrunner Swap VS Hunters" challenge inspired by Dream's popular video series.

## Overview

The plugin facilitates a contest between two teams: **Runners** and **Hunters**.

The **Runners** share a single player "body." This means they share the same inventory, health, hunger, location, and all other player states. Control of this shared body swaps between the runners on a configurable timer. The goal of the runners is to beat the game (e.g., defeat the Ender Dragon).

The **Hunters'** goal is to eliminate the active runner before they can achieve their objective.

When a runner is not in control, they are "blacked out"â€”rendered blind and immobile until it's their turn again.

## Features

*   **Full State Synchronization**: On every swap, the active runner's entire state is deeply copied to the next runner, including inventory, health, food, XP, location, and potion effects.
*   **Advanced Swap Timer**: Supports both `FIXED` and `RANDOM` swap intervals. The random mode uses a Gaussian distribution for more natural-feeling, less predictable swaps.
*   **Game State Persistence**: The game state is saved to a `game_state.json` file on pause or server shutdown. The game can be safely resumed exactly where it left off, even after a full server restart.
*   **Immersive Blackout State**: Inactive runners are rendered completely blind and immobile, and are isolated from runner-to-runner communication in chat and private messages.
*   **Configurable Hunter Tracker**: Hunters can track the runner using a combination of modes:
    *   `COMPASS`: A standard compass that points to the runner's last location. Can be configured to only work in the same world.
    *   `GLOWING`: Applies a glowing effect to the runner that is only visible to hunters.
    *   `ACTION_BAR`: Displays the runner's coordinates in the hunter's action bar.
*   **Fairness and Administration**:
    *   **Safe Swaps**: Ensures players are not swapped into dangerous blocks like lava or inside a wall.
    *   **Grace Period**: A configurable period of invulnerability for the newly swapped-in runner.
    *   **World Whitelist**: Restrict game creation to specific worlds.
*   **Comprehensive GUI**: A full GUI system (`/swap gui`) for managing teams and changing key game settings live without needing to edit the config file.
*   **Extensibility for Developers**:
    *   **PlaceholderAPI Support**: Exposes placeholders for use in other plugins.
    *   **Custom Events**: Fires a rich set of custom Bukkit events for other plugins to hook into.

## Commands and Permissions

The main command is `/swap`. All subcommands require the `speedrunnerswap.command` permission, which is granted to OPs by default.

*   `/swap gui`: Opens the main graphical user interface.
*   `/swap start`: Starts the game.
*   `/swap stop`: Stops the game.
*   `/swap pause`: Pauses the game.
*   `/swap resume`: Resumes a paused game.
*   `/swap status`: Shows the current status of the game.
*   `/swap setrunners <player1> [player2] ...`: Sets the players for the runner team.
*   `/swap sethunters <player1> [player2] ...`: Sets the players for the hunter team.
*   `/swap reload`: Reloads the configuration file (this will stop any running game). Requires `speedrunnerswap.admin`.

## PlaceholderAPI Placeholders

If you have PlaceholderAPI installed, you can use the following placeholders:

*   `%speedrunnerswap_active_runner%`: Displays the name of the current active runner.
*   `%speedrunnerswap_time_left%`: Displays the number of seconds until the next swap.
*   `%speedrunnerswap_time_left_formatted%`: Displays the time until the next swap in `MM:SS` format.
*   `%speedrunnerswap_game_status%`: Displays the current game status (Running, Paused, or Stopped).

## API for Developers (Custom Events)

You can hook into the plugin's logic by listening for these custom Bukkit events:

*   `GameStartEvent`: Fired when a game starts.
*   `GameStopEvent`: Fired when a game is stopped.
*   `GamePauseEvent`: Fired when a game is paused.
*   `GameResumeEvent`: Fired when a game is resumed.
*   `PlayerSwapEvent`: Fired when control swaps between runners.
    *   `getPreviousRunner()`: Returns the `Player` who was previously active.
    *   `getNewRunner()`: Returns the `Player` who is now active.
